	<h1>Welcome to Ana's Tech Notes!</h1>
	<p>My name is Ana Lovejoy and this is my tech blog. Here you will find different kinds projects. Most or all of them will have code associated with them. I hope that each blog post will be something that someone can use or adapt for their own use or just learn something from. I spend some of my time doing self-study and I might use this blog as a means to hold me accountable and solve some problems and post my solutions here to add to the pool of the already available solutions out there. I welcome feedback. I find it to be very effective in speeding up one's improvement.</p>

    <p>My interests lie in computer vision and robotics. I did my masters research in those area. I have also had several engineering computer vision roles in the industry.</p>

    <p>I love matrices and clever ways they are used in different applied areas, more specifically in computer vision. I am interested in neural networks. I have a tendency to like simple ideas and neural networks sometimes seemed to me like a mysterious, complex gigantic hammer, which made me prefer other techniques. However, I was finally set straight by Yann Lecun and his statement (paraphrased here) that we should not use complexity as a reason not to engage in a field of study. That and of course the enormous successes they have had. It also seems like that, despite their complexity, there are ways to improve them by using simple, clever ideas. Like Generative Adversarial Networks. </p>

    <p>I have had less exposure to robotics than to computer vision, but it is an area I have worked on during my masters and in my free time for a stealth startup and for self-study.</p> 

    <p>I also believe in having strong foundations in a variety of subjects. So I spend a part of my time revising or learning graduate level materials on topics such as Probabilistic Robotics, Geometric Algorithms, Numerical Analysis etc. </p>
