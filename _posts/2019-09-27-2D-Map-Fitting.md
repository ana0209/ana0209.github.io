This project arose when I was trying to compare several 2D lidar based SLAM algorithms. I was having a robot move around a part of my home with a lidar mounted on top of it. I tested gmapping, Cartographer SLAM and Karto SLAM. I had generated the ground truth map manually. I wanted to fit the calculated maps by each of the algorithms to the ground truth map. It looked simple, but I could not find any ready made, accurate code out there. I found this project: https://github.com/saeedghsh/Map-Alignment-2D that looks interesting but it did not work for all of my maps. I decided to take some ideas from it and write my own code. This is the result.
